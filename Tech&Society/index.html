                <h2>Universal <span>design</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Automatic <a href="https://www.dormakaba.com/us-en/solutions/products/entrance-systems/automatic-sliding-doors---icu-doors-" target="_blank">sliding doors</a> are, for example, 
                    a <a href="https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/" target="_blank">universal design</a> we all encounter daily. 
                    The concept is simple, doors that open automatically by sensors detecting that someone is in front and 
                    opening without assistance. This way, people in wheelchairs, the blind, the elderly, children and more 
                    can get in and out of places without a problem. Not only is it easier for users with 
                    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability.html" target="_blank">disabilities</a>, 
                    but also for us. Often our hands are full of different things, and if we had to put down everything we hold 
                    each time to grab a door handle it would have been cumbersome, but with automatic sliding doors we do not 
                    encounter this problem. Given the current <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">corona</a> 
                    situation, this is more hygienic so that diseases are reduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator" target="_blank">elevator</a>, which is a means of transport for people 
                    and is an alternative way to get to different floors. It is a modern and easily accessible design that everyone encounters on a daily 
                    basis and can be used by any user. Elevators are most suitable for the disabled, the elderly and pregnant 
                    women and have often adapted functions that in turn adapt to the user's needs, such as shutter speed and buttons 
                    with <a href="https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/braille/what-braille" target="_blank">Braille</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use the elevator everyday, for example at school in situations with heavy bags or that teaching is on the highest floor, 
                    so our everyday life becomes easier and we save energy and time from having to walk / use stairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The latest universal design we have chosen is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-floor_bus" target="_blank">low floor</a> . 
                    Low floors mean that the floor on different public 
                    transport is at the same level as the pavement the vehicle is next to. This is assigned to people who have challenges 
                    getting up from the sidewalk and up to the vehicle. This can prevent injuries, accidents or passengers being forgotten. 
                    We meet this design in everyday life, which makes it easier for us to get on the collective. We do not need to take 
                    into account the height difference between the vehicle and the pavement, and do not think about any damage caused by 
                    the gap in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Universal design helps different people in everyday life and improves the quality of life. Both automatic sliding doors, 
                    lifts and low floors are modern designs that help people in everyday life without making a clear distinction in society, 
                    and which we ourselves use every day.
