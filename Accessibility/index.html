                    The first thing we did was to create a template for what we wanted the website to look like. 
                    We started with the welcome page where we created a body with a nav, header, main and a footer. 
                    We started by making a navbar and header. Then we put in a background-image in the body for the whole page. 
                    We then wrote a short text about what this website will obtain. Finally, 
                    we added links to the school's different social media accounts via a href links in the footer. 
                    Furthermore, we entered the various texts we needed in a google docs and copied them directly into vscode. 
                    We did not need to do much more on the other pages since we already had a "skeleton" from the welcome page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we coded the fun page was by creating the background and the layout of the page in an external program called canva. 
                    This made it easier to see where the images and texts should be placed. 
                    We decided to have the buddy week as a theme for the fun page, and used the same code for the slideshow as we used in oblig1. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose to try and code as simple as possible. We used w3schools a lot, because 
                    this is a site everyone in the group feels use codes that are easy to understand for amateurs like us. 
                    We also used coding that Carlos has gone through in class and previous code from the obliges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To assure accessibility of our website, we got random students to check out our page both on their PC and on their phones. 
                    We asked them to find the different pages, such as the "reflection" page, and to change the language from Norwegian to English. 
                    In this way we were able to confirm that the page was neat and easy to handle. We also got feedback on what worked and 
                    what was perhaps a little more convoluted. An example of what we changed with the help of the feedback was to make the 
                    text of the navigation bar larger so that you did not click on the wrong page when you were on the website via mobile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When our website was almost complete we ran it through <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">wave</a> to check accessibility (check pictures under). 
                    We also validated our html and css code using <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">W3C</a>'s validator (check pictures under).
                    This helped us pick up small errors and alerts. The accessibility test on wave explained what the errors and alerts ment, which helpes us understand them better. 
                    We had, among other things, forgotten to identify the language of the site, as well as adding an alternative text to images. We also tried 
                    opening the website in different browser to be sure it worked, which it did. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we consistently inspected the pages as we worked on them to find unnecessary code etc.
